# Belly Button Biodiversity (Module 12 Challenge)

## Overview
Roza needs to visualize the bacterial data for each participants. Her volunteers should be able to identify the 10 bacterial species in their belly buttons. That way, if Improbable Beef identifies a species as a candidate to manufacture synthetic beef, Roza's volunteers will be able to identify whether that species is found in their navel.

## Results
### Deliverable-1
In this section, we've created a dynamic bar-chart for the top 10 bacterial species, that changes as the user select the volunteer-id from the dropdown list.

### Deliverable-2
In this section, we've created a dynamic bubble-chart that plots the complete set of bacterial species and it changes as the user select the volunteer-id from the dropdown list.

### Deliverable-3
This was an interesting deliverable. In this, we created a gauge chart. As the user selects the volunteer id, it shows its "weekly washing frequesncy". It's a cool visual presentation.

### Deliverable-4
We have done many customizations to the original plot.

1. Our web page is now, [responsive](https://github.com/neerajain9/Belly_Button_Biodiversity/blob/Data-Science/Resources/responsvie.png).

2. We have changed the [layout](https://github.com/neerajain9/Belly_Button_Biodiversity/blob/Data-Science/Resources/layout.png).

3. We have inserted a [banner picture](https://github.com/neerajain9/Belly_Button_Biodiversity/blob/Data-Science/Resources/banner.png) through Jumbotron.

4. We have inserted a soothing background picture. (refer in final layout)

5. We have customized the font styles, color, and type. (refer in final layout)

6. We have added the color scale to the right of the bubble chart. (refer in final layout)

[This is how our final page looks now!](https://github.com/neerajain9/Belly_Button_Biodiversity/blob/Data-Science/Resources/final.png)

## Summary
It was a lot of fun in creating these cool visualizations!
